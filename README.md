# Enhancing Secure Data Exchange with Encoding Formats and Protocol Integration

## Overview
This repository contains supporting materials for the coursework on secure data exchange. It explores encoding formats such as Base64, ASCII, Hex, and URL encoding in combination with secure protocols including HTTPS, TLS, and SMTP.

## Repository Structure

- diagrams/ → Contains data flow diagrams illustrating encoding and TLS integration.
- code/ → Demonstration scripts showing Base64 and URL encoding implementations.
- report/ → Final coursework report (PDF version).

## Key Concepts Covered

- Base64 encoding in TLS-based email transmission
- URL encoding in HTTP requests
- Secure REST API communication using HTTPS
- Risks of encoding-based obfuscation
- Enhanced integration strategies for secure data exchange

## Technologies Used
